# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis 

Software's used Python, Pandas, CSV files & creating Data Frames. 

## Purpose 

Client was told academic dishonesty accured during standardized testing, at Thomas High. By replacing the math and reading scores of all 9th graders with NaN's, I was able to restore academic honesty. In doing so, this provides the data to stay intact and determine any changes to the overall analysis. 

## Results 

Using the Loc method, 9th graders math and reading scores from Thomas High, were changed to NaN.
